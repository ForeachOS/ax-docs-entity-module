The following section gives an overview of common customizations for generated entity views.

[[view-builder-initializer]]
=== Customizing the EntityViewFactoryBuilderInitializer
//DOCUMENTATION TODO: customize view builder initializer

=== Changing entity names, property names or other labels
All entity names, property names and labels can be customized using message sources.
For an explanation of the different message codes used, see <<appendix-message-codes,the relevant appendix>>.

See also the section on <<configuring-form-text,configuring form controls text>> for common customizations.

[[customize-page-layout]]
=== Setting page title or changing page layout
Setting a page title can be done by adding the corresponding message code.
All default views automatically add a page title (optionally with sub text) if the corresponding message code resolves a non-empty string.

See the <<appendix-message-codes,message codes appendix>> for a list of relevant message codes.

.Changing the page layout
Entity views use a `PageContentStructure` for the base structure of the web page.
The `PageContentStructure` is available as a request scoped bean, but can also be retrieved from the `EntityViewRequest`.

See the {url-AdminWebModule}#page-content-structure[AdminWebModule reference documentation] for a basic explanation of `PageContentStructure`.

.Modifying the page layout for all (or a selection of) views
If you want to modify page layout for multiple views at runtime, you can subscribe to the {entity-module-javadoc}/com/foreach/across/modules/entity/views/processors/support/EntityPageStructureRenderedEvent.html[`EntityPageStructureRenderedEvent`].
This event is published during the `postRender()` phase and gives you context of the view that is being rendered, allowing you to make changes outside regular `EntityViewProcessor` implementations.

`SingleEntityPageStructureViewProcessor` and `ListPageStructureViewProcessor` are the <<appendix-view-processors,view processors>> responsible for building the basic page structure and publishing the event.

=== Specifying a custom template

Every default view uses a specific (Thymeleaf) template that renders the `ViewElement` list created by the view.
If you want control over the rendering through a separate template you can specify a different template using the `template()` method on the `EntityViewFactoryBuilder`.

=== EntityViewProcessor

Modifying a default view can be done by registering an `EntityViewProcessor` for that view.
This API allows you to modify the `ViewElement` collection that should be generated.
This is a useful hook to add for example custom form elements that you wish to add and process.
If can also be used to reorganize the layout of the form from backend code using the `ContainerViewElementUtils`.

=== Using a custom EntityViewFactory

Full control can be done by registering a custom `EntityViewFactory` implementation.

=== Selecting properties
`EntityPropertySelector`, incremental builders, keep current, select all, select all without default filter, exclude

[[configuring-views]]
==== Configuring views
Existing views can be modified or new ones registered using an `EntityViewFactoryBuilder` or `EntityListViewFactoryBuilder`.
You usually don't create these manually but get a builder for the corresponding view from the configuration or association builder.

The builders provide common properties that will configure one or more `EntityViewProcessor` instances on the view factory.
They also allow you to modify the processor collection directly by adding or removing processors, or by post-processing the entire `EntityViewProcessorRegistry`.

.Example adding an EntityViewProcessor to the default list view
[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
configuration.withType( MyEntity.class )
             .listView( lvb -> lvb.viewProcessor( myProcessor ) );

The following chapters provide some more details on how to configure the default view types.
