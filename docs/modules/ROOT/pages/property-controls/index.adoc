= Entity property controls

== Configuring property view types
You can configure a property using the `EntityPropertyDescriptorBuilder`.
This builder also contains some methods to influence the `ViewElement` that should be built for that property for a given mode.

By default a `ViewElement` will be built based on the property and some of its annotations.
There are 3 ways you can influence the default behaviour:

* specify a custom `viewElementType()` for a given mode
** a default builder of that type will be created for that mode
* specify one or more `viewElementPostProcessor()` for a given mode
** these `ViewElementPostProcessor` instances will be added to the default builder, in the order they were registered
* specify a custom  `viewElementBuilder()` for a given mode
** the default building will be ignored and only your custom builder will be used
