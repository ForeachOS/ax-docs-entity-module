= Creating a property control

== Property data binding

When rendering forms you often want to use the form data to update the related property value.
This process is called _data binding_.

EntityModule builds on top of the Spring `WebDataBinder` and provides additional features for binding data to complex property types.

See the xref:property-controls/creating-a-property-control/property-data-binding.adoc[separate section] for a full explanation.
