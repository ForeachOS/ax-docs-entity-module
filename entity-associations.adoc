== Entity associations

The `EntityModule` attempts to automatically detect related entities and creates associations mainly to facilitate UI generation.
Currently `@OneToMany`, `@ManyToMany` and `@ManyToOne` annotations from `javax.persistence` API are all scanned and used to build `EntityAssociation` entries.

In the administrative UI the management of related entities can often be done either through the property or the association.
This is especially the case for `@ManyToMany` and `@OneToMany` associations that are mapped through a property with collection type.
By default related entity management will be done through the property and the association will be generated but hidden.

NOTE: If you want to enable management through the association interface, you should manipulate the `hidden` property of both the association and the property using an `EntityConfigurer`.

    // Groups should be managed through the association instead of the property
    configuration.withType( MachinePrincipal.class )
                 .properties( props -> props.property( "groups" ).hidden( true ) )
                 .association( ab -> ab.name( "machinePrincipal.groups" ).show() );

=== Association type
Every `EntityAssociation` is of a specific type, configured through the *associationType* property.
The association type determines how the associated values can be managed through the user interface.

The following association types are possible:

[cols=2,options=header,cols="1,3"]
|===

|Association type
|Behaviour

|`LINKED`
|The related entities are only linked to.
The tab of the parent entity shows the list of related entities, but any modify action will navigate away from the parent entity.

This is the appropriate type if your related entities can in turn have other related entities.
Usually this also means the related entity type has a main menu item.

|`EMBEDDED`
|The related entities will be managed through the tab of their parent entity.
Modifying a related entity will be displayed as modifying the parent entity, no action will leave the context of the parent entity.

Use this type if the related entities only exist if their parent exists.
Usually the related entity type does not have any menu item, nor sub tabs (the latter would not be displayed).

|===

By default an association is of type `LINKED`.

=== ParentDeleteMode
An `EntityAssociation` has a *parentDeleteMode* property that determines how associated items will influence the ability to delete in the user interface.
The default value is `SUPPRESS` but can be set through the `EntitiesConfigurationBuilder`.

For more information see the <<delete-view,delete view chapter>>.

=== Association naming and location
Associations are added to the `EntityConfiguration` for which it makes most sense to manage them from a UI perspective.
The association naming however is done according to the entity class and property names.

Example:

* entity `Group`
* entity `User` has a one to many with `Group` on property *groups*
* association *user.groups* will be created on the entity configuration of `Group`

=== Customize associated entity creation
You can customize the creation of an associated entity in the form views, by setting a custom `EntityFactory`.
This is especially useful for manually creating associations.

An `EntityAssociation` can have an `EntityFactory.class` attribute set that contains the `EntityFactory` that should be used for creating associated items.
If no factory is set as attribute on the association, the default `EntityFactory` of the target configuration will be used.

If there is an `EntityFactory` attribute set on the association, that factory will be used when creating a new associated entity instance.
The `createNew()` factory method will get called with the parent entity (for whom an associated item is being created) as single parameter.
