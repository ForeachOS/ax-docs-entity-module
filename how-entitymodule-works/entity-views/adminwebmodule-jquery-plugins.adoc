=== AdminWebModule JQuery plugins
The default EntityModule web resources add some JQuery based javascript plugins.

==== EntityModule object
All EntityModule and BootstrapUiModule javascript can be initialized by calling `EntityModule.initializeFormElements()`.
This method optionally takes an argument that is the node in which the form elements should be initialized.

This is automatically done on document load, but when using AJAX fragment rendering, you usually want to re-initialize the DOM element that was updated.

.Custom initializers
You can easily add a custom initializer function by adding it with `EntityModule.registerInitializer( callback )`.
There is no need to manually execute your callback on document load, as that will happen automatically by the EntityModule.

NOTE: Don't execute your callback on document load and then add it to the initializers.
Execution will happen automatically when calling `registerInitializer()`.

.Example registering a custom initializer that configures a sortable table to use AJAX loading
[source,html,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
EntityModule.registerInitializer( function( node ) {
    $( '[data-tbl-type="paged"]', node )
        .on( "emSortableTable:prepareData", function( e, params ) {
            console.log( "enhancing the data", params );
            params['_partial'] = 'content';
        } )
        .on( "emSortableTable:loadData", function( e, params ) {
            console.log( "performing ajax load" );
            e.preventDefault();

            $.get( '#', $.param( params, true ), function( data ) {
                   $( '.pcs' ).replaceWith( data );
                   // initialize the form elements in the element just updated
                   EntityModule.initializeFormElements( $('.pcs') );
               }
            );
        } )
} );

==== Sortable tables
The default list views support paging and sorting of the pages, where client-side code is used to trigger reloading of the page.

Every table matching the selector *[data-tbl-type="paged"]* will be initialized for sorting and paging.
A sortable table considers 3 default parameters:

* _page_: page number
* _size_: number of results a single page should have
* _sort_: array of sort strings: _field,direction_ (eg. _name,ASC_)

If a table is bound to a form (specified by the _data-tbl-form_ attribute), paging or sorting will result in that form being submitted with the parameters being added as hidden form elements.
If no form is bound, the current URL will be reloaded and the parameters added to the query string.

.Customizing behaviour
You can hook into the default behaviour by using the events a sortable table emits or listens to.

[cols="1,4,4",opts=header]
|===

|Event
|Description
|Argument

|emSortableTable:moveToPage
|Trigger this event if you want to reload the data for a specific page.
|Page number.

|emSortableTable:sort
|Trigger this event if you want to reload the data with different sorting.
If the data is already sorted on the field specified, the sort order will be reversed.
|Name of the field to sort on.
Usually value of the _data-tbl-field_ attribute.

|emSortableTable:prepareData
|Called after determining page number, result size and fields to sort on.
Subscribe to this event if you want to expand or modify the parameters that should be submitted.
|Parameter map containing: _page_,_size_ and _sort_ keys.

|emSortableTable:loadData
|Called after the parameters for the data have been prepared.
Subscribe to this event if you want to provide a custom method of fetching the data (eg AJAX based).
Note that you have to prevent the default execution if you provide your own mechanism.
|Parameters that should be used for fetching the data.

.Manually creating sortable tables
If you want to manually initialize a sortable table you can directly call the JQuery plugin *emSortableTable()* on any element.

NOTE: You can easily create the valid structure for a sortable table using the `EntityViewElementBuilderHelper`.
This allows you to create a `SortableTableBuilder` that builds a `ViewElement` that renders the right markup including all data attributes.

A valid sortable table requires several data attributes to be present on the DOM element:

[cols="1,4",opts=header]
|===

|Attribute
|Description

|*data-tbl*
|Unique id of the data table.
 Also used on column headings and pager control elements to specify the table they belong to.

|*data-tbl-form*
|(Optional) Name of the form that should be submitted when reloading the table data.

|*data-tbl-total-pages*
|Total number of pages in the result set.

|*data-tbl-size*
|Single page size.

|*data-tbl-current-page*
|Current page number (0 based).

|*data-tbl-sort*
|Current sort value.
This is a JSON object structure containing the actual sort fields and their order.
Depending on the the presence of custom `Sort.Order.class` attributes on the `EntityPropertyDescriptor` these field names will be the same as the property names.

|*data-tbl-field*
| Only used on heading cells that should be sortable.
Specifies the field this column represents.

|*data-tbl-sort-property*
|Only used on heading cells that should be sortable.
Contains the actual property name that is being sorted on.
Usually the same as the field name.

|*data-tbl-page-selector*
|Used on a pager text field that contains the page number.

|*data-tbl-page*
|Used on any element that should navigate to a page on a click event.
Contains the value of the page that should be navigated to.
