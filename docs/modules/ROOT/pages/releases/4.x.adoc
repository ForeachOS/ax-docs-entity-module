= 4.x.x release notes

[#4-0-0]
== 4.0.0.RELEASE

* Behaviour of `EntityLinkBuilder` has been changed due to changes in Spring 5 concerning URL encoding of parameters.
** All `linkTo` calls in `EntityViewLinks` will automatically URL encode `from` parameters correctly.
** All calls to `withPartial`, `withFromUrl`, `withViewName`, `withQueryParam` will automatically URL encode `from` parameters correctly.
** Calls to to `.queryParam` are now seen as literals and will not be url encoded anymore.
If you want query parameters to be encoded you must use templated variables as seen on https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.0.8.BUILD-SNAPSHOT/spring-framework-reference/web.html#web-uri-encoding.
