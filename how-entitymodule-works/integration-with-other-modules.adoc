== Integration with other modules

[[integration:adminwebmodule]]
==== AdminWebModule

If the AdminWebModule is present entity management controllers will be created for all registered entity configurations.
If you want to avoid the automatic registration of entity management controllers for a particular entity type, you should set the `EntityConfiguration` as `hidden`.
This will effectively disable the default entity controllers for that type, and hide the existence of the entity type from the administration interface.

You can also hide one or more associations.
By default an association will not be shown if one of the participating entities is hidden.
If you specify the `hidden` property of an `EntityAssociation` explicitly, that value will take precedence of the entity configurations.
This way it is possible to generate management pages for associated entities, but not for the main entity type.

==== AdminWebModule: developer tools
When integrated with AdminWebModule and development mode is active, an entity registry browser will be added to the _Developer tools_ section of the administration ui.
The browser allows you to inspect the registered entities along with their views, associations and properties.


=== Auditable
If _SpringSecurityModule_ is present, EntityModule adapts the default views for `Auditable` entities.
The *createdBy* and *lastModifiedBy* properties are rendered using an `AuditablePrincipalPropertyViewElementBuilder` which uses the `SecurityPrincipalLabelResolverStrategy` to generate a pretty label for a principal (eg. full name instead of username).
The default properties are removed from default views, but an aggregated property *created* and *lastModified* is added.
The aggregated properties combine both the timestamp and the principal in a single property using the `AuditablePropertyViewElementBuilder`.

See the `AuditableEntityUiConfiguration` for full customization.
