= 3.x.x release notes

[#3-2-0]
== 3.2.0.RELEASE

This release contains a lot of internal changes, specifically related to the addition of the `EntityPropertyController` and the `EntityPropertiesBinder`.
Overall upgrading from the previous version should be seamless for most applications.

* addition of `EntityAttributes.FORM_ENCTYPE` that can be specified as `EntityViewFactory` or `EntityPropertyDescriptor` attribute
** its value should be the actual enctype that should be used for submitting the form of a form view, eg `FormViewElement.ENC_MULTIPART`
** this is especially useful to change the form enctype based on the presence of property descriptors (for example a file property)
** the attribute on a `EntityViewFactory` will take precedence, property descriptors will only be inspected if it is missing
* more options are now available for xref:property-controls/fieldset.adoc[fieldset property controls]
** a fieldset can now be rendered either as a HTML `FieldsetFormElement` or using a custom template
** a custom template can be configured on a property using the `ViewElementFieldset.TEMPLATE` attribute
** several default templates have been provided with default styling for common form layouts in Admin Web
** if no property selector is specified, a fieldset property will select all child properties as its members
*  added support for xref:building-views/list-view.adoc#filter-by-access[filtering a list view based on `AllowableAction`]
** this can be used to hide items from a list view if the user does not have the correct permissions
* addition of the xref:building-views/form-view.adoc#detail-view[detail view] which offers a readonly view for entities.
** it's possible to configure an entity to link to the detail view instead of the update view by default
* link to the delete view (delete button) has moved from the tab menu (`EntityAdminMenu`) to the detail and update view
** see the xref:guides:form-view/customize-link-to-delete-view.adoc[customize link to delete view] guide to revert to the previous behaviour.
* embedded association views now include an inner page (tab) title and menu
** the sub-menu is only rendered if there are at least 2 menu items
** this allows an additional level of menu items for managing embedded associations
* addition of the `EntityPropertiesBinder` which allows more advanced binding of custom properties
** each property is now backed by an `EntityPropertyController` which can be used to set behaviour (data fetching, writing) on a single property level
* collections of embedded objects (eg `List<Address>`) are now fully supported and a default UI control will be generated
* several bugfixes and minor improvements:
** fixed some issues with using `UUID` or other custom types as id for entities
** added default control support for `ZonedDateTime` and `Duration`
** added EQL support for `CONTAINS NULL` as an alternative to `IS EMPTY`
*** this can be used in combination with groups: `CONTAINS (NULL,1)` is the equivalent or `CONTAINS 1 or IS EMPTY`
*** this also fixes some issues when using a collection type property in a  basic EQL filter
** improved EQL support for negative operands: `NOT CONTAINS (1,2)` now expands to `NOT CONTAINS 1 AND NOT CONTAINS 2`


[#3-1-0]
== 3.1.0.RELEASE

* if an `EntityAssociation` has a custom `EntityFactory` attribute, that factory will be used for both new instance and DTO creation
** previously it was only used for new instance creation
* EntityModule now uses `evo-inflector` to auto-generate plural forms, this should yield better results in English
* the `String` formats of auditable properties can now be customized using global xref:services-and-components/message-codes.adoc[message codes]:
** `Auditable.createdDate`
** `Auditable.created`
** `Auditable.lastModifiedDate`
** `Auditable.lastModified`
* several minor issues with EQL filtering have been fixed
* `EntityQuery` condition translation is now done recursively as long as the result is modified
* a `CollectionEntityQueryExecutor` implementation has been added that can be used to query a collection of objects if there is an `EntityPropertyRegistry` which provides the property metadata of the collection members

[#3-0-1]
== 3.0.1.RELEASE

* the module dependencies for EntityModule have been optimized for re-use
** as a result EntityModule no longer transitively pulls in BootstrapUiModule or AdminWebModule
** when used without BootstrapUiModule, no default `ViewElement` rendering infrastructure will be available
** when used with BootstrapUiModule but without AdminWebModule, the default views for an entity will never get created and view support (`EntityViewFactory`) will be disabled
* added support for `LocalDate`, `LocalTime` and `LocalDateTime` to be rendered using `DateTimeFormElement`
* it is now possible to configure default view element modes (eg. control or readonly rendering) on an `EntityConfiguration`
** these will be used in all cases where no specific configuration has been configured on property level
* configuration & view builders support `AttributeRegistrar` for registering or removing attributes
** using `AttributeRegistrar` is useful if you want to use the owner of the attribute collection (eg. the `EntityConfiguration`)
** common default registrars can be found in the `EntityAttributeRegistrars` utility class
* entity views can now have a xref:services-and-components/attributes-overview.adoc#appendix-entity-view-factory-attributes[collection of configuration attributes]
** attributes can be used to influence or extend default behaviour, new attributes are available for permission checking and admin menu rendering
** during view rendering attributes are accessible (and can be modified) using `EntityViewRequest.getConfigurationAttributes()`
* improvements to view configuration
** `EntityViewFactoryAttributes.ADMIN_MENU` attribute can be used to specify if a view should have an admin menu item added
** `EntityViewFactoryAttributes.ACCESS_VALIDATOR` attribute can be used to determine how access to the view should be validated
* added an `ExtensionViewProcessorAdapter` base class for easily creating a view for a custom extension class (see xref:guides:form-view/creating-an-extension-form.adoc[how-to])
* added `EntityViewCustomizers` utility class providing some helpers for customizing `EntityViewFactoryBuilder` in a chainable fashion
* EntityModule no longer creates its own `Validator` instance, the `registerForMvc` related settings have been removed
** the validator used by EntityModule is the default MVC validator
* it's now possible to xref:services-and-components/message-codes.adoc#customizing-message-code-prefix[define a different message code prefix] for module entities using properties
* you can now force the required status of a control by setting the `EntityAttributes.REQUIRED_PROPERTY` attribute to `true` or `false` on an `EntityPropertyDescriptor`
* message codes for form groups and fieldsets have been extended, apart from `[description]`, there is now also built-in support for `[help]` and `[tooltip]`
** this constitutes a minor breaking change in that `[description]` content is now always rendered above the control of a form group.
Previously this could be different depending on the type of control inside the form group.
** see the section xref:building-views/form-view.adoc#configuring-form-text[configuring form controls text] for a full explanation of the new message codes
* the behaviour of when controls are prefixed with `entity.` has been changed
** when using `EntityViewCommand` all property controls of the base entity will should be prefixed with `entity.` in order to map on the `EntityViewCommand.entity` values
** previously this was done always when an `EntityViewCommand` was found on the `ViewElementBuilderContext`
** in the new version this is only done if there is also an attribute `EntityPropertyControlNamePostProcessor.PREFIX_CONTROL_NAMES` explicitly set to `true` on the builder context
*** the latter is done automatically by the `PropertyRenderingViewProcessor` when building the initial controls
** though not intentionally breaking, this change can have side effects with controls no longer being prefixed, developers are encouraged to test the custom forms they have
* new components for linking to entity views have been introduced
** the old `EntityLinkBuilder` interface and attributes are deprecated, but should still work as before
** see the chapter on xref:building-views/linking-to-entity-views.adoc[linking to entity views] for an overview of the new components
