== EntityQuery Language (EQL)

Apart from building an `EntityQuery` in code, one can be specified using the EntityQuery Language (EQL).
EQL provides an SQL-like syntax for building queries.  Some examples could be:

* `name = 'john'`
* `order by birthday asc`
* `name = 'john' order by birthday desc, registrationDate asc`
* `name = 'john' and birthday >= '1980-01-01'`
* `(name in ('john', 'jane') and birthday = today()) or birthday is EMPTY order by name asc`
* `children contains 'john' or children is EMPTY`

A single clause of a query consists of a _field_, followed by an _operator_, followed by one or more _values_ or _functions_.
Multiple _values_ for one field are grouped together inside parentheses.
Clauses can be combined using either _and_ or _or_.
Operator precedence can be enforced by using parentheses around a clause.

A _field_ of a query clause usually corresponds with a single property you want to query.

A SQL-like _order by_ clause specifying one or more properties is also supported.
An EQL statement with only an ordering clause will select all items in that order.

> Special characters in string literals should be escaped using the \\ (backslash) character.
In case of like conditions, they should be double-escaped.

=== Supported operators

==== Equality operators
Usable on most property types.

[cols="1,2",opts=header]
|===

|Operator
|Description

|`=`
| equals

|`!=`
| not equals

|===

==== IN/NOT IN
Usable on most property types.
These are the only operators that take a group of values as argument.

[cols="1,2",opts=header]
|===

|Operator
|Description

|`IN`
| equal to any of the argument values

|`NOT IN`
| not equal to any of the argument values

|===

==== Comparing operators
Usable on numeric and date property types.

[cols="1,2",opts=header]
|===

|`>`
| greater than

|`>=`
| greater than or equal to

|`<`
| less than

|`<=`
| less than or equal to

|===

==== LIKE operators
Usable on string property types.
The argument specifies the pattern that property value should match.
The pattern can contain simple wildcard specified using **%**.

[cols="1,2",opts=header]
|===

|Operator
|Description

|`LIKE`
| should match the pattern specified as argument

|`NOT LIKE`
| should not match the pattern specified as argument

|`ILIKE`
| case insensitive match of the pattern specified as argument

|`NOT ILIKE`
| should not match the pattern specified as argument (case insensitive)

|===

> **NOTE**
Special characters in LIKE statements should be double-escaped using the \ (backslash) character.
This includes the literal % (percentage) character.

**Case insensitive property matching**
When using **ILIKE** conditions, a case insensitive lookup will be performed in the datastore.
If you want to force a property to always have a case insensitive lookup, you can do so by configuring a `EntityQueryConditionTranslator` attribute on that property.

```java
configuration
 .withType( Group.class )
 .properties(
    props -> props.property( "name" ).attribute( EntityQueryConditionTranslator.class, EntityQueryConditionTranslator.ignoreCase() )
 )
```

This will convert any equality or like operator to the equivalent case insensitive lookup.

> **WARNING**
Whenever possible, it is probably best to use collation settings of your datastore to ensure case insensitive querying of properties.  Configuring it on a datastore level will almost certainly give you much better performance.  If collation is not possible, investigate the option of using function indices on the relevant columns.

==== CONTAINS/NOT CONTAINS
Usable on collection or text property types.
In case of text the contains statement is translated to a like statement with wildcards before and after.

[cols="1,2",opts=header]
|===

|Operator
|Description

|`CONTAINS`
| argument should be present in the collection or string should be present in the text

|`NOT CONTAINS`
| argument should not be present in the collection or string should not be present in the text

|===

==== IS NULL/IS NOT NULL
Usable on single value properties only.
These operators to not take any additional arguments.

[cols="1,2",opts=header]
|===

|Operator
|Description

|`IS NULL`
| property should not be set (null)

|`IS NOT NULL`
| property should be set (not null)

|===

==== IS EMPTY/IS NOT EMPTY
Preferred for collection type properties, altough usually will work as an alternative for `IS NULL`/`IS NOT NULL` on single value properties.  These operators to not take any additional arguments.

[cols="1,2",opts=header]
|===

|Operator
|Description

|`IS EMPTY`
| property should not have any members (in case of collection) or should not be set (if single value property)

|`IS NOT EMPTY`
| property should have at least one member (in case of collection) or should be set (if single value property)

|===

=== Default EQL functions

**Security related functions**

[cols="1,2",opts=header]
|===

|Function
|Description

|`currentUser()`
| returns the name of the current authenticated principal

|===

**Date and time functions**

[cols="1,2",opts=header]
|===

|Function
|Description

|`now()`
| returns current timestamp

|`today()`
| returns date of today

|===

=== EntityQueryParser

The `EntityQueryParser` is responsible for converting an EQL statement into a valid `EntityQuery`.
Any entity configuration with an `EntityQueryExecutor` registered will have an `EntityQueryParser` created automatically.

The parser will validate the EQL statement and convert it to a strongly typed `EntityQuery`.
The default `EntityQueryParser` uses the entity related `EntityPropertyRegistry` to validate the query clauses.
